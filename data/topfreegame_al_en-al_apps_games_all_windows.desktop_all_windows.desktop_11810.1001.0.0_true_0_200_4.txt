Your customers will place pizza orders that you must build and serve before the time runs out. Use ingredients to build the perfect pizzas and get paid money by your happy clients! Finish the pizzas and earn enough money to move on to the next day. Fail, and you lose your job!\r\n\r\nIn Pizza Chef, there are two modes of play: Career Mode and Time Attack. In Career Mode, you must earn one hundred dollars each day in order to progress on to the next day. As you progress, the levels become harder as more ingredients are added to the pizzas, and the orders start to get more and more out of control. Keep your customers happy! Career Mode contains a total of 50 levels for non stop fun and family friendly action.\r\n\r\nTime Attack mode is unlocked by reaching day 10 in Career Mode. In Time Attack mode you are given 20 seconds to build as many pizzas as you can. Each time you complete an order, you get 10 more seconds added to the clock. Pound out pizzas as fast as you can and see how much money you can make!\r\n\r\nPizza Chef is an entertaining game of skill, wit, reflexes, memorization, and time management. It is a fun game for kids and adults of all ages. I am always improving my games and looking to add more content, so please leave me suggestions on how I can make the game better!

This is a shortened version of the “Nature for Tots” app.\r\n \r\nTogether with your child, you can watch wonderful images of fruits and vegetables, all while learning their names!\r\n\r\nAfter the child has looked through all the flashcards, he or she can take a fun quiz to see how many of the words he or she knows. Regardless of the number of correct answers given, and of stars earned, the child's developing skills will be fostered by enthusiastic applause and floating balloons!\r\n\r\nThis educational application contains full set of “Fruits” and “Vegetables” flashcards from the “Nature for Kids” application. In addition, it includes the clipped demo sets of the following groups of educational cards: “Berries”, “Flowers”, “Mushrooms”, “Nature” (sea, island, forest, river, mountain, etc.), “Seasons”, “Natural phenomena” (rain, rainbow, lightning, etc.).\r\n\r\nDoes the youngster have an older brother or sister in grade school? They can also use this educational game! Besides English, this app also supports the German, Russian and Ukrainian languages. \r\n\r\nWhile playing with flashcards in a foreign language, a school-age child can effortlessly learn many new words with which to surprise their foreign language teachers and classmates. An A+ is sure to follow! \r\n\r\nIn order to use this educational app, the youngster does not need to be able to read. The simple interface and spoken clues allow even the youngest of children to play and learn independently!\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that children love to look through a series of colorful pictures with sounds, and they will ask to see them again and again. According to Glenn Doman, an American physical therapist and the founder of The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential, participating in these kinds of educational activities (for 5-10 minutes a day) stimulates the development of various regions in the brain. As a result, the child's photographic memory takes shape, the child develops much faster than his or her peers, and, beginning at infancy, the child gains access to a world of encyclopedic knowledge. \r\n\r\nThe main point, in which Doman is undoubtedly correct, is that the younger a child, the more easily he or she can absorb new knowledge. It's important to make use of this ability while it's available!\r\n\r\nThe app can be used as a supplementary teaching aid in foreign language instruction. Supported languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Russian, Polish, Ukrainian.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDSHWN","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Cars for Kids - truck, tractor, vehicle sounds learning games for toddlers","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40408.9007199266578621.a4937e1d-b8e6-489a-97de-5f64e242ea3a.32ecbe3e-296f-4c03-ab44-637947ee9276","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33226.9007199266578621.1b7f0e94-ba36-4962-a448-6de324267c50.10eaec50-ed28-4f41-b117-0e430201060b","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47076.9007199266578621.401dbc84-c274-4323-ba8f-7533cbd223e6.eb4ae5d3-8ff1-4373-a581-e10fedc00501","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22828.9007199266578621.2c679b4b-24a8-4a0a-859e-efb19a3ec74b.5449397d-c5f2-4c31-98e8-6497857aa62d","Height":558,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54986.9007199266578621.541bbd7b-5c38-4165-a499-cc00148d85f0.d262576b-122c-435c-8495-96c778317bc7","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64926.9007199266578621.bd31768e-df27-4f6f-ae7f-aab17c089580.050849bd-8feb-4d9a-9c78-1a33f08b6c76","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.60899.9007199266578621.e7ebab22-0852-4d9d-82e9-665392d476d1.4b5f1a59-b08b-4cb0-bc5e-6ddac31ed165","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["32004CLEVERBIT.2897EA8040B5_krxe918j0j7ce"],"ContentIds":["b9f1af58-545b-d8d5-325f-3001676a9888","6a67cd91-4fef-a789-4fb4-b630719c6bc5","5fd408ae-51cb-0364-5b93-fb3831f4417a"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"“Cars for Kids” is a free learning game for children between the ages of 1 and 4.\r\n\r\nLearning about cars, vehicles and other type of transportation has never been easier.

New story filled with magic, treachery and brave feats. Are you ready? \r\nThe story of the game starts in the kingdom of old Viking king Arnar. Turns out, he was cursed by a vicious dwarf. Not just a dwarf, but Loki (the Scandinavian god of mischief) himself. The reason was simple – a precious ring. Arnar found it and refused to sell it. Many years later, the curse got through to him. This is where the action begins.

A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans.\r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. Highly skilled drivers control a high powered street car past its limit, sideways at high speed, burning rubber. It can’t get any better!\r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://en.ratrodstudio.com/support/ \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com\r\nFOLLOW US: twitter.com/ratrodstudio","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJCJG","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Spider Solitaire Collection Free","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30186.9007199266251693.bb4553e8-86e7-4b65-a9bb-6ccdeefd7c17.7029e085-f4cb-4e12-87fa-02b34ae24bc4","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#1C9558","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16164.9007199266251693.66ae06c0-6c6e-4e12-9ca1-a4924d81279d.89b01d1e-ced4-41aa-89a0-5394eda92e87","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#1C9558","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13860.9007199266251693.07fcfec6-96ef-4efa-ad1f-f58d3fc2cf71.54beb575-389f-4e45-8761-065ae2353863","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#1C9558","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60912.9007199266251693.22012260-3791-462d-92ff-332d36a0745e.f2c61312-addc-411f-a884-31371d573bee","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#1C9558","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9171.9007199266251693.dadf7317-414c-4739-9d67-5e0d6b1e029b.2a6ca758-fe2b-43fb-9718-976ff9c25668","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#1C9558","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4931.9007199266251693.c9425b5b-a57a-430e-a7ad-7992c64aaaee.215790f5-62b6-4aa1-bb32-5c3d80095267","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#1C9558","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22327.9007199266251693.04d1c893-44fa-4f36-9f6d-e71941f601e8.25aad5f8-30e4-4d0b-9216-6382050bcfa5","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#1C9558","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60399.9007199266251693.31a64ec2-546a-4571-9bd9-5f87f0029533.9097ab22-6ae5-480e-b833-01bc7f90409a","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#1C9558","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55753.9007199266251693.923bd944-547f-4039-81b7-88ed123a189c.cda166b8-cb6d-4628-8a7c-51782b6b6ebf","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["TreeCardGames.SpiderSolitaireCollectionFree_n666hb6ddc5jp"],"ContentIds":["b8f1098c-a6ee-4b90-e51d-1342746aafd9","9d7c8ccf-c695-298c-1f82-2d4a6c7b9645","630f6217-a186-344c-ff87-8f382dbec7ab"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Play a free beautiful collection of Spider solitaire game variations, including:\r\n- Spider\r\n- Spider One Suit\r\n- Spider Two Suits\r\n- Scorpion\r\n\r\nWe support our apps and your feedback is welcome.

You can only collect the maximum number of prizes if you find the optimal solution. Every move you make off of the optimal path moves all the prizes one step nearer to the exit and possibly out of the maze. When you find the optimal solution for a maze at one level you will move onto the next level. The next level will have more 'cells' but might have an optimal solution with fewer moves since the mazes are randomly generated as needed.\r\n\r\nYou can move through the maze by dragging the avatar, by using the thumb-friendly arrow buttons at the side of the screen, or by using a mouse or keyboard (if attached).\r\n\r\nYou can zoom into the maze to make moving by dragging easier; but if you do this you can't see the complete maze at one time.\r\n\r\nThere are various themes which you can select or let the app decide on one for you based on the current date (e.g. Easter, Christmas, St. Patrick's Day, Thanksgiving, Halloween).\r\n\r\nYou can make life easier with various feedback options (i.e. showing where the prizes are hidden or changing the appearance of the avatar when off the optimal path). You can let the App show you the optimal solution but if you do this you don't advance to the next level. You can restart the maze at any stage and revert to the state just after doing a new maze. However you can't undo the effects of getting the App to show you the optimal solution by doing this. You will need to create a new maze.\r\n\r\nThe maximum level you can reach depends on the resolution of your device. However when you reach the maximum level you can still get new mazes to solve as each time you select a new maze it is randomly generated on the fly.\r\n\r\nThe application does not connect to the internet and thus cannot share any information about you with others. The Toolbar button to show my web-site (with contact information) uses the standard browser. The application stores a small amount of data on your device to allow it to resume from where you left off even after restarting the device.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJVJ9","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Christmas Tree-d","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14250.9007199266275046.2a872b44-77d7-4869-a231-258a3c044aa8.683a551e-03e8-4dfc-8466-b91b0a2c3ecb","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64363.9007199266275046.04922ebe-e5a3-4e29-9a33-740f6f76bee3.18838268-5be1-40c8-8427-2d69c202f4f8","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["30698EirikBerntsen.ChristmasTree-d_sj3n3ynfhajc6"],"ContentIds":["f42bd296-901d-c3fc-df75-b1e953f48ee0"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Help the kitten prepare for Christmas!
