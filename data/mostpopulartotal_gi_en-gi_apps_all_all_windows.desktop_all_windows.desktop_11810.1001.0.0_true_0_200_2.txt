You discover the API 500-inspired Channel Strip, you learn why the amazingly useful MixConsole Snapshot feature is such a timesaver, and you learn about the improved side-chaining capabilities of Cubase. Josh also covers Groove Agent SE 5, the new saturation plugin Distroyer, VariAudio 3, and the new audio alignment feature...\r\n\r\nSo whether you're an experienced Cubase user or you're completely new to Steinberg’s powerful DAW, watch this course to get up to speed with the brand-new features!","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9P9QQ3QVC3BB","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"eWeapons™ Gun Simulator Free","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48179.14137868147302893.019df3df-6fe6-422c-8193-3e5579ae91fd.3f795e3e-23e9-40c9-a972-3de78b14f52a","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10487.14137868147302893.b3e6a055-3ee1-4d3f-80a2-ed655c8ab7f4.087798d0-7a21-4e3c-94b5-0479f3b8040c","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["22527ina.petrova.85.eWeaponsGunSimulatorFree_7d2m0mhkspagw"],"ContentIds":["1e618401-0111-3d4f-c9ea-c28523d94b67","5163d993-c767-d61d-b35a-e08d95afe1c7"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Start your journey through the world of guns with eWeapons™ Gun Simulator Free.

This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\r\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\r\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors.

An early variant of Tic-tac-toe was played in Roman Empire, around the first century BC. It was called Terni Lapilli and instead of having any number of pieces, each player only had three, thus they had to move them around to empty spaces to keep playing. The game's grid markings have been found chalked all over Rome. However, there is some evidence to suggest that Tic-Tac-Toe could originate back to ancient Egypt. \r\nThe different names of the game are more recent. The first print reference to \"noughts and crosses\", the British name, appeared in 1864. The first print reference to a game called \"tick-tack-toe\" occurred in 1884, but referred to \"a children's game played on a slate, consisting in trying with the eyes shut to bring the pencil down on one of the numbers of a set, the number hit being scored\". \"Tic-tac-toe\" may also derive from \"tick-tack\", the name of an old version of backgammon first described in 1558. The U.S. renaming of noughts and crosses as tic-tac-toe occurred in the 20th century. \r\nWhen playing against a phone, human player is always 'O'. The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. Using menu button, game can be configured to play on the larger boards to connect 4 pieces, or between 2 people.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

It's for babies, toddlers, or anyone who benefits from learning about shapes, patterns, matching, and early motor skills.  The default mode is to connect two shapes by tapping one and then the matching one. When two shapes are connected, a light tone is played, and when all the shapes on the screen are connected, a fun WIN sound is played. Ads are included to keep the game free, and for a small fee they can be removed... but if you like the game, it would be great if you could click an ad every now and then.\r\n\r\nSettings are accessed through the Windows 8 Settings interface, making it less likely for your little one to need to ask you for help if they get into it.  You can set up the game to:\r\n\r\n* Tap, drag a line, or draw a line to connect shapes. Tapping works great for children under 2 years old.\r\n\r\n* Match either 2, 3, 4, or a random number (between 2, 3, and 4) of shapes on the screen.\r\n\r\n* Choose between connecting 2-dimensional shapes, 3-dimensional shapes, or 3-dimensional outlines.\r\n\r\n* Race - Play 5 games with the current settings. The total time is shown, and if the previous best time is beat, the winner can save their name. This mode ended up being surprisingly fun for parents and older siblings.\r\n\r\n* Enable or disable sounds.\r\n\r\nThis game is for the best people around, and I hope you and your child enjoy it as much as my young testers did. Thanks for trying it out, let me know if there are any problems, and if you like it please give it a positive rating.\r\n\r\nPrivacy Statement: This application does not collect any of your personal information.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDMLVN","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Bad Nerd - School RPG","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42124.9007199266448791.fa0f079b-e09a-4f6f-b62c-750d93c49e04.c67d47ed-c550-4153-b2ca-abd4c540ad7f","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37851.9007199266448791.38f4e3d1-2a40-46ed-8922-da8f66fc0a8f.b25a6a7b-fec8-494f-97ad-6d2dd7054196","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["VNLEntertainmentLtd.BadNerd-SchoolRPG_xaadq54jk5f4e"],"ContentIds":["9c1b78c6-a5f1-37dc-2e3a-5e8b7dfc5188","1bc338f0-29e1-673b-8b47-bd665e2370be"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"NOTE: This game requires touch input and does not support mouse and keyboard.\r\n\r\nSee a nerd unleash the nerd rage like never before!\r\n\r\nIf you are a fan of modern action RPGs with lots of fighting then you will love Bad Nerd!\r\nJoin Bad Nerd in his quest to rid the school of bullies!

Board pieces move based on dice throws.\r\n\r\nThis is a game of skill. A single game can be decided by luck, but the more one plays, the more the skill is important. After ~30 games the true skill emerges. Even a beginner can beat an expert through luck of draw in a single game, but after several games the skill prevails.\r\n\r\nThis version of Backgammon uses an advanced neural network in the highest levels, and will challenge advanced players. It also offers a fun experience for beginners, with lower difficulty levels and showing possible moves.\r\n\r\nThe scoring is based on the official Backgammon ELO system, with each game increasing or reducing rating points every game or match.\r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n=========\r\n* Worldwide online high scores\r\n* Play a Trial Game, or a Scored Game that counts towards your score\r\n* High res graphic board\r\n* Dice statistics history\r\n* Real time probability calculation\r\n* Achievements\r\n* Tutorials\r\n* 4 difficulty levels: easy to hard\r\n* 1 or 2 player mode\r\n* Many options:\r\n    -

The app also includes free taster versions of the eBooks so you can even try before you buy.\r\n\r\nThese eBooks are a great resource supporting our world famous RYA Training Courses such as those within the trademark RYA Yachtmaster Scheme, the RYA Powerboat Scheme and the RYA Dinghy Sailing & Windsurfing Schemes among others. You will find eBooks of essential and recommended titles along with plenty of further reading and development, whether you’re starting to sail by taking a Competent Crew course, taking things further with a Day Skipper course or taking your RYA Yachtmaster exam – whatever you need, we’ve got it covered!\r\n\r\nThere are great examples throughout our range of our use of interactive content in areas such as seamanship, boat handling, passage planning, knots and stability but you’ll find something very special in our editions for:\r\n\r\n•\tVHF – where we’ve created animated examples of the voice procedures in the RYA VHF Handbook to help students pass the RYA SRC exam and also linked the content to sample questions.\r\n•\tNavigation – where we’ve developed a special tool to replicate using the tidal curves in the RYA Training Almanacs\r\n•\tThe Racing Rules of Sailing – where we’ve developed our own rules engine which links the racing rules to RYA and ISAF cases and also Q&As.\r\n\r\nAlthough these eBooks are designed for tablets, we’re still keeping smart phones very much in mind. This way, you’ll still be able to access the enhanced interactive content on the smaller devices even if you feel you wouldn't read a book on something so small.\r\n\r\nThere’s plenty for instructors as well with not only the interactive content, that can be used as demonstrations and enhanced learning on and off the water. There are also a whole host of useful features, (which we’re always evolving) such as bookmarking, note taking and inter-edition linking that will help you manage the content you want to support the way you teach.\r\n\r\nThis updated version of the app now includes a wider range of boating categories to make it easier for you to navigate all the new content that we are regularly adding:\r\n\r\n•             Sail\r\n•             Dinghy\r\n•             Sail Racing\r\n•             Sail Cruising\r\n•             Windsurfing\r\n•             Power\r\n•             Powerboating\r\n•             Motor Cruising\r\n•             Personal Watercraft\r\n•             Inland Waterways","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9P17X7NRH9TJ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Word Crossy - A crossword game","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33105.14516488293559613.304c0049-b983-4880-bbe0-064640a1da70.3dfd3ec8-c5da-470e-b74f-7909fbf8d670","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63175.14516488293559613.304c0049-b983-4880-bbe0-064640a1da70.c2ff1066-80f9-4266-a401-6f18eb9548cf","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["1727Riz.WordMind_yyvbx0pk3r5fr"],"ContentIds":["0f9a8ac6-1bf1-7086-3d25-9701db764d04","856efe11-3823-a974-4bf6-8590dd44fae0","327afc01-edbd-0ad9-43ae-dbd64ac4d50a"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Enjoy word games?

Writer is a free text and code editor app with over 20 supported file types, and active syntax highlighting that updates as you edit documents.  Use it as a replacement for Notepad and other quick edit apps.\r\n\r\nThe app has been built from the ground up for Windows 10.  It's fast and fluid, and gives you the power to edit documents with features you'd normally only find in desktop apps.  Code Writer is perfect for editing any text-based file, doing code reviews, or giving presentations with code samples.\r\n\r\nThe text editor allows you to edit documents in near full-screen mode with the chrome fading to the background.  The collapsible side bar houses features like a document explorer, search functionality, advanced editing commands, print/share, settings, and help.  A popup command palette provides quick keyboard access to almost every command in the app.\r\n\r\nEasily create new or open existing documents from any accessible source.  Color is used pervasively throughout the app to create a bond between you and the various file types you work with.\r\n\r\nConfigure the editor theme and other options such as font size to mold your ideal editing environment.  Learn about every product feature with the included detailed documentation.\r\n\r\nThe app requires Windows Fall Creators Update or later, and is fully supported on ARM, x86, and x64 devices.\r\n\r\nIF YOU LIKE THIS FREE APP, PLEASE SUPPORT ITS CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT WITH GOOD RATINGS.  We have many plans for further improvements but want to hear your suggestions too.  It is most helpful if you post your own ideas for app features in our support forum or in the Windows Feedback app (instead of or in addition to reviews in the Store) so that we can communicate directly with you.  Sometimes we may need more information about the feature request and by posting in our forums or the Feedback app, we can get that from you.  Thank you for your support, it is much appreciated.

These users can unlock speech functionality through an in-app purchase at any time.\r\n    - Users who purchased a Tobii Dynavox device. Users in this group will have full app functionality (including speech) when the app is (re)installed on their Tobii Dynavox device.\r\n\r\nDo you believe that communication growth, engagement, and literacy is possible for your child? We do. Snap + Core First is a symbol-based communication app designed to be the most intuitive solution on the market. Snap + Core First lets users start communicating quickly and stay engaged as they grow and evolve on their communication journey. Centered on Tobii Dynavox’s Core First approach to delivering a systematic, proven, research-based Core Word framework, this app provides the fastest and most efficient platform for communication for all users including students, parents, and teachers. \r\n\r\n\"Snap + Core First is so fast and responsive! When you touch a symbol, you get immediate voice output. This ensures the motor, auditory, and visual input the user gets when they activate a button is simultaneous and that helps the child learn!\" - SLP AND PROFESSOR FROM VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY \r\n\r\nWith Snap + Core First learning language, achieving literacy, and becoming an independent communicator is possible! \r\n\r\nWho is Snap + Core First for? \r\n\r\nSnap + Core First is ideal for individuals with Autism, Down Syndrome, Cerebral Palsy, and intellectual disabilities. It is currently available in English and can be used on any up-to-date Windows 10 device. \r\n\r\nResearch-based for success \r\n\r\nThe success of the Snap + Core First platform stems from the cohesive use of the Core Word framework, topics, quick phrases, behavior supports, word lists, and keyboards that let a user naturally engage with others. Core First, which is rooted in research by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, helps the communicator continuously build vocabulary and skills and takes advantage of motor learning by introducing new vocabulary systematically and purposefully, which allows users to move up or down and always know where to find vocabulary. It is built on three pillars for communication success: growth, engagement, and literacy. \r\n\r\nDesigned for easy customization and consistency \r\n\r\nSnap + Core First has a user interface that allows for easy editing and grid size changes, common functions for dragging and dropping, quicker actions for linking pages, and a new Search tool for finding words quickly. A wide variety of Acapela voices are also available as free downloads in the paid version of the app. \r\n\r\nA comprehensive ecosystem of support \r\n\r\nTo keep your focus on communication growth, Snap + Core First is backed by access to a truly unparalleled and free ecosystem of content and a library of resources.

Play 40 different levels, and build bridges over deep valleys, canals, and rivers. Stress tests reveal whether the bridge you build can withstand the daily stress of continual use from cars, trucks and, more recently, super-heavy tank trucks.\r\n\r\nYou can choose between a range of materials for each individual bridge, such as wood, steel, cables, or concrete pillars. Use the appropriate materials and stay within budget to build the perfect bridge. The choice of different materials means that there are numerous solutions and approaches and you can build each bridge in any number of ways – your budget is the only limit. The refined grid system allows you to realize your idea of the perfect bridge with even more precision. Let your imagination and creativity run free! And if you happen to run into a dead end, you can pick up valuable tips from the brand new help system!\r\n\r\nAvailable ingame: SlopeMania!\r\nIn the SlopeMania add-on you find yourself on the Tiltin Islands, home to three brand new islands where you'll even be building your bridges inside colorful grottoes! The 24 tricky, never-before-seen levels will have you using sloping lanes to overcome the massive height differences.

It also allows uploading images, text or other types of files to over 80 supported destinations you can choose from.\r\n\r\nShareX supports many ways to capture or record your screen. The main capture methods are:\r\n\r\n• Fullscreen\r\n• Active window\r\n• Active monitor\r\n• Window menu\r\n• Monitor menu\r\n• Region\r\n• Region (Light)\r\n• Region (Transparent)\r\n• Last region\r\n• Custom region\r\n• Screen recording\r\n• Screen recording (GIF)\r\n• Scrolling capture\r\n• Webpage capture\r\n• Text capture (OCR)\r\n• Auto capture\r\n\r\nThere are many configurable screen capture settings such as showing the cursor, transparent window capture, delayed capture, multiple region selection with different shapes, etc.\r\n\r\nAfter the capture the following automated tasks can be executed:\r\n\r\n• Show quick task menu\r\n• Show \"After capture\" window\r\n• Add image effects / watermark\r\n• Annotate image\r\n• Copy image to clipboard\r\n• Print image\r\n• Save image to file\r\n• Save image to file as...\r\n• Save thumbnail image to file\r\n• Perform actions\r\n• Copy file to clipboard\r\n• Copy file path to clipboard\r\n• Show file in explorer\r\n• Recognize text (OCR)\r\n• Show \"Before upload\" window\r\n• Upload image to host\r\n• Delete file locally\r\n\r\nFor example, the captured image can be opened in image annotator and after that, the image can be automatically saved to the hard disk and uploaded to your destination of choice.\r\n\r\nShareX allows you to upload any type of files with these methods:\r\n\r\n• Upload file\r\n• Upload folder\r\n• Upload from clipboard\r\n• Upload from URL\r\n• Drag and drop upload\r\n• Upload from Windows shell context menu\r\n• Upload from Windows send to menu\r\n• Watch folder\r\n\r\nAfter the upload, any of the following automated tasks can be executed:\r\n\r\n• Show \"After upload\" window\r\n• Shorten URL\r\n• Share URL\r\n• Copy URL to clipboard\r\n• Open URL\r\n• Show QR code window\r\n\r\nFor example, the uploaded image URL can be automatically shortened using one of the 15 URL shortener services and the shortened URL can be copied to the clipboard.\r\n\r\nShareX also comes with a few simple productivity tools:\r\n\r\n• Color picker\r\n• Screen color picker\r\n• Annotate image\r\n• Image effects\r\n• Hash check\r\n• DNS changer\r\n• QR code\r\n• Ruler\r\n• Directory indexer\r\n• Image combiner\r\n• Image thumbnailer\r\n• Video thumbnailer\r\n• FTP client\r\n• Tweet message\r\n• Monitor test\r\n\r\nShareX has an advanced hotkey system which allows you to use any of these capture methods, upload options or tools with their own task settings. These are called \"Workflows\". Workflows allow each hotkey to have its own after capture tasks, after upload tasks, destination etc. For example, you can set your screen recording hotkey to upload to a specific destination, bypassing the default destination. This way, only videos will be uploaded to this configured file destination.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9P19X39KXR0H","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Live Football TV","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64485.14510781272086748.d3de2ab7-536e-4ed6-a4b7-82040b48b504.6b1e2a91-2ce8-4b78-af4d-5fbfac940fef","Height":188,"Width":188,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39559.14510781272086748.d3de2ab7-536e-4ed6-a4b7-82040b48b504.85b3a7d2-2727-4038-9b0a-50c0da36a11f","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14965.14510781272086748.d3de2ab7-536e-4ed6-a4b7-82040b48b504.3d30e0d2-8ecf-4429-926f-1472e7b6980a","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18088.14510781272086748.d3de2ab7-536e-4ed6-a4b7-82040b48b504.e7d0be96-c0b7-4d6d-9466-02f819d9d7cd","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56081.14510781272086748.d3de2ab7-536e-4ed6-a4b7-82040b48b504.e6f5ec48-13f8-4e9a-be4c-bf572aac1f24","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4034.14510781272086748.d3de2ab7-536e-4ed6-a4b7-82040b48b504.45e50d79-6deb-4b93-9550-8b8c02d4e468","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18851.14510781272086748.d3de2ab7-536e-4ed6-a4b7-82040b48b504.22237505-db35-4fda-9662-0ced1125530c","Height":188,"Width":388,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36342.14510781272086748.d3de2ab7-536e-4ed6-a4b7-82040b48b504.396332fa-4719-44c3-9b1f-1ec36c8f0dfc","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41654.14510781272086748.d3de2ab7-536e-4ed6-a4b7-82040b48b504.35ac2a71-e3cb-4e39-bac1-6e043299cdf7","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["49177PopcornMedia.22830BEBAB5FF_r9qdaz17sw6c4"],"ContentIds":["43bb0392-f0d2-0314-584f-ff782f9c8e98","cb8a4296-52ae-4da8-9c1c-9ab015e45afd"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Watch your favorite football series such as\r\n1.

Duplex Media Player will cast any media to any device even if the device doesn’t support it (for example, Chromecast doesn’t support .FLV files, with Duplex Media Player you can now cast .FLV and other files to Chromecast devices)\r\n\r\nIn addition, if you have a slow network connection, or your media content was encoded with a high bit rate which is not suitable for casting, Duplex Media Player can generate a ready to cast copy which is suitable for casting and smooth playing.\r\n\r\nSubtitles\r\n----------\r\nIn addition to loading local subtitles, Duplex Media Player can automatically search and download subtitles for you. You can also configure the appearance of the subtitles. In addition, time correction feature will allow you to adjust subtitle times.\r\n\r\nRecordings & Downloads\r\n------------------------------\r\nWith a single tap, you can start and stop recording easily. You can record live and online streams to your device at any time. Even if you are using Pip, you can record each player separately.\r\n\r\nIn addition, you can download full content from online sources\r\n\r\nMedia Sources\r\n------------------\r\nDuplex Media Player supports several media sources, you can create playlists from local files, OneDrive content, network media servers and also from popular online sources such as YouTube, Twitch, Vimeo, SoundCloud, Dailymotion and SHOUTcast\r\n\r\nAudio/Video Codecs\r\n------------------------\r\nDuplex Media Player supports all known video/audio codecs. You don’t have to install any external codecs.  If you try to play .rm or .flv or any other format that is not supported in Windows 10, then Duplex Media Player is what you are looking for.\r\n\r\n\r\n*** All features of this app are free except for the advanced features (casting, downloading, recording and playing from OneDrive and UPNP servers)\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH67591","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"CropiPic -
