It is one of the best known board games of all-time.\r\n\r\nThe classic fast-trading property game features tokens from the 1930s all the way to the 2000s, with a beautiful game board and cards, the game takes you back to when it all began, but you still have to build your houses and hotels and see if you can bankrupt everyone else. The jet-set gameplay will be epic as you race around the world to visit the world’s most exciting places and buy locations.\r\n\r\nOnopoly is also known popularly called Business Board Game, The Landlord's Game and Finance\r\n\r\nOnopoly is a great game for 2 - 6 players. It is a board game where players roll two six-sided dice to move around the game board, buying and trading properties, and develop them with houses and hotels. Players collect rent from their opponents, with the goal being to drive them into bankruptcy. \r\n\r\nMoney can also be gained or lost through Chance and Community Chest cards, and tax squares; players can end up in jail, which they cannot move from until they have met one of several conditions. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.\r\n\r\nPlay against the computer, against your friends in Local mode or with Thousands of Onopoly players around the world in Online Multiplayer Mode.\r\n\r\nYou can also create Private Rooms and invite your friends to play in Play with Friends Mode.\r\n\r\nOnopoly is a simple game: you start off with some money, and your goal is to be the last player standing with money. The way you win in Monopoly is by collecting rents on property, or cash flow.\r\n\r\nOnopoly brilliantly combines both strategy and chance. It gets stressful and exciting, especially when things get closer to the endgame. \r\n\r\nYou better keep an eye on your money, because you never know when the dice will land you with a massive rent bill to pay. Sometimes staying in jail can be the safest place to be, but only after your properties are primed to make you money.\r\n\r\nYou’ve got to buy, sell and negotiate to win. Everyone loves the timeless game-play of Onopoly. \r\n\r\nTry to win the onopoly game by buying all the property and collecting as much money as possible. \r\nWill you be able to defeat your opponents? \r\n\r\nDownload Onopoly for free!!\r\n\r\n◆◆◆◆ Onopoly Features◆◆◆◆\r\n\r\n✔ Create Private Room and Invite Friends and Family\r\n✔ True multiplayer where you can play with real people online in online multiplayer mode.\r\n✔ Adaptable intelligence with smart AI when playing against computer\r\n✔ Play with players across the world\r\n✔ 2, 3,4,5 or 6 Player Mode \r\n✔ Play with Local Multiplayer\r\n \r\nPlease don't forget to Rate and Review Onopoly! \r\n\r\nYour Reviews Matter!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH1XXCL","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Truck Driver Job","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57262.13510798886177531.a312956e-e60f-4895-a8cd-043c6af590c7.7d085b4c-0d1c-4e56-84fa-6d3e71da46dd","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32871.13510798886177531.28d0cf5a-ab7f-4d30-952d-ea3cf9a6c8ce.b818f144-cbe5-4ead-b33c-2f5305a4657f","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48269.13510798886177531.a869dcf8-7720-4b07-a14c-44fc695d9d36.d19b7885-e4f5-4a1c-b293-1a85c321b6df","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["2739ChimpiGames.TruckDriverJob_7pgfw3wsaeyma"],"ContentIds":["b188f733-e4b7-a7bf-7278-85e01ec554aa","ad4d11f4-748a-11dd-f90a-20222fd1619f","9b207b6d-784e-d075-c644-4b5e1f57f862"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Tired of parking trucks?

The object is to move the pieces around the board towards your inner table. Once all 15 of your pieces have arrived in the inner table, they can be removed from the board. The first player to remove all his pieces from the board is the winner. Although the play is highly skilful, the fact that the moves rely on the roll of the dice introduces an element of luck allowing even a novice to win the odd game against a world champion.\r\n\r\nBackgammon has been played throughout the world for thousands of years. ZingMagic's version of Backgammon enables you to play this most popular of board games to a high standard anytime, anywhere.

the edge of your seat. Optimized for mobile users, this extreme fighter game is ripe with challenges. Walk around this 3D pixel world and confront deadly enemies all while collection an assortment of sophisticated, modern day weapons, ammo and health. Bring down your wrath in an amazing mission with varied enemies. Become the last line of defense in a sci-fi world of epic proportions. Enemies are everywhere and you must defeat every last one in order to claim the title as ultimate victor. \r\n\r\n??Time is running out...??\r\n\r\nI am a prisoner on a planet in a galaxy devoid of human life. I know little about my origins, only that the planet had seen a total annihilation of human life centuries ago at the hands of the robots who dominated it and I was the last human on earth. I exist in a cell so tiny that I cannot lay flat, but rather have to sleep in the fetal position. My cell is always cold and drips waste from the city above. I have seen light very few times in my existence, but when I have, I was chained in manacles and paraded about the city to the delight of the robots and their fat, alien comrades. I harbored no hope of leaving this place. That was, until six months ago when I heard it whispered between wardens that a planet was discovered where humans not only exist, they thrive. The word war was being bandied about, but I cared naught of their tactics, for the first bloom of hope had sprung to life in my chest. For the first time since I was a wee boy and my spunk was beaten mercilessly from me, I was determined to be more than a prisoner. Despite the size of my cage, I refused to let my surroundings hinder my plans of escape. I worked out tirelessly, working my weary bones until I could start to feel the strength building in my body. I would escape, but to fully succeed and reunite with those of my own ilk, I would need to confront these foes and escape this hell hole altogether. This is my tale, the story of how I escaped this planet and vanquished my enemies.\r\n\r\n??Ready your weapons...??\r\n\r\nThis mission features a great variety of enemies, but when you start the game, you will be unarmed. In order to do battle, you must locate and equip a weapon. A selection of melee and firearm weapons exist across the maps. Your entity map will be a valuable asset as it allows you an aerial view of oncoming enemies so you can be prepared to strike. Collect health and ammo perks while you can, for these pickups will decrease as the levels progress making your mission all the more challenging. Let your surroundings aid your quest. Exploding barrels can be found and utilized to strategically take down enemies. Enjoy non-stop FPS action with endless battles and treacherous terrain. \r\n\r\nHow to play: Use the simple touch screen control pad to easily move, fight, select weapons and more. Kill enemies, utilize exploding barrels. Keep an eye out for hidden perks and weapons. \r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n-Addictive and mesmerizing maps\r\n-Efficient weapon controls and movement\r\n-Fight your way against dozens of foes\r\n-Think strategically\r\n-Interactive surroundings\r\n-Heated gun battles and ruthless snipers\r\n-Pixel style defense game\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NT92R25SJVN","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Snail Bob! 2","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13379.14418362713579287.d4cd43f9-bbf3-4d0c-ab77-c4c9e54fac1c.bc338129-07c4-49f2-84a4-a8d9ca712b01","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20619.14418362713579287.3bd04156-7a2c-4372-8524-25ee5362158d.5ce659a5-b2d2-4a3c-9669-0ffd74111ca3","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["39135goatgame.SnailBob2_p6fh3swgmjcvc"],"ContentIds":["0c704c14-4f4a-580f-b43c-2d436a61e8de","78e8d789-9cbc-f0c0-db22-8bf4f856a1df"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"A dangerous forest stands between Snail Bob and his Grandpa's birthday party!

Completed sets of cards will be automatically removed from the board and you score points. In order to win you have to remove all the cards from the board.\r\n✓ Drag-and-drop cards or simply tap on the cards to move them on an eligible column.\r\n✓ In games with more than one suit, in order for a set to be complete, all the cards in that column need to be in order and of the same suit. When you are successful in building a set, these will be automatically removed from the board. \r\n✓ You are allowed to mix different suits as long as the cards are in a descending order. But you cannot move the stacks, unless they're of the same suit.\r\n✓ If you ever get empty columns you can place any card or any stack there.\r\n✓ When you run out of useful moves, tap on the stock pile at the bottom of the screen to be dealt a new row of cards.\r\n✓ You can only deal a new row of cards when all the columns are filled. Place at least one card on every column to be allowed to be dealt new rows of cards.\r\n✓ By default the set number of suits is 2. But you can change it from the main menu. To enter the main menu and to also pause the game just press on the button in the top left corner of the screen. You can change the number of suits from 2 to 4, from 4 to 1 and from 1 to 2. The changes take effect when you start a new game. \r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

The 28 domino tiles are shuffled face down and form the stock or boneyard. Each player draws seven tiles; the remainder are not used. Once the players begin drawing tiles, they are typically placed on-edge before the players, so that each player can see his own domino tiles, but none can see the value of other players' tiles. Every player can thus see how many tiles remain in the other players' hands at all times during gameplay. One player begins by downing (playing the first tile) one of their tiles. In different games first tiles are also different. In Muggins player should start with the highest double (6-6), in Bergen the first move should be 0-0, in Mexican train each round starts with the next lower double. This tile starts the line of play, a series of tiles in which adjacent tiles touch with matching, i.e. equal, values. The players alternately extend the line of play with one tile at one of its two ends. The game ends when one player wins by playing their last tile, or when the game is blocked because neither player can play. If that occurs, whoever caused the block gets all of the remaining player points not counting their own.\r\n- Scoring game\r\nPlayers accrue points during game play for certain configurations, moves, or emptying one's hand. Most scoring games use variations of the draw game. In Muggins (All fives) player must make the open ends of the layout add up to 5s or a multiple of five (5s, 10, 15, 20, etc.) In bergen player scores when numbers on the open ends are equal. If a player does not call \"domino\" before the tile is laid on the table, and another player says 'domino' after the tile is laid, the first player must pick up an extra domino. In Mexican train the double zero domino is scored as 50 points.\r\n- Draw game\r\nIn a draw game (blocking or scoring), players are additionally allowed to draw as many tiles as desired from the stock before playing a tile. The score of a game is the number of pips in the losing player's hand plus the number of pips in the stock. Most rules prescribe that two tiles need to remain in the stock. The Draw game is often referred to as simply \"dominos\".\r\n\r\nIf you like board games like Checkers, Mahjong, Backgammon and Chess, you will love Dominoes: Best Classic Dominoes Board Game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFHZWV","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"City Racing 3D","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.65320.9007199266248855.fef45a50-484a-4e0c-8b52-8357cfd2b070.95ae79e9-5450-47f5-8196-1d36d9501c97","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17050.9007199266248855.d3631183-097d-4896-9d15-b29234afa4ed.2dbc86be-d2bf-4f3e-b9bc-5bb32241d267","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2805.9007199266248855.0737a5d2-2372-4f85-96e3-a723c019cb4e.8565b5cc-e8cb-4d34-91c9-a6758208af77","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46671.9007199266248855.d310a4bb-4f85-42de-9ab3-a7175f151b8c.fb663e7f-8acd-4d23-b36a-f5405d4a6f22","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.0,"RatingsCount":"2","PackageFamilyNames":["B9BA84AC.CityRacing3D_3ag0hv5nd203a"],"ContentIds":["d09ba0fa-ba7e-341b-94bb-6955fbc6b1e5","87ba1cc9-5673-b0cd-aa1d-b741cf6af08c"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Support: feamber@hotmail.com\r\nThe PURE REAL 3D racing experience proudly presented by Feamber!

It is played on a square board, made of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares on each side. Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king. The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. Checkmate is a threat ('check') to the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game.\r\nDuring the game the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One player ('White') has pieces of a light color; the other player ('Black') has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move, and about taking the opponent's pieces off the board. The player with white pieces always makes the first move. Because of this, White has a small advantage, and wins more often than Black in tournament games.\r\nDeveloping Chess strategy and improving your Chess skill!
